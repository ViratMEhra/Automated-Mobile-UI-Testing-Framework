# 🧠 Mock E-Commerce API with Postman Testing

This project is a simple mock API built for an e-commerce platform to manage orders and payments.  
I created it to practice how real-world APIs are designed, tested, and validated using **Postman**.  
The goal was to simulate core operations like creating, updating, and deleting orders while ensuring each endpoint works correctly through automated Postman tests.

## ⚙️ What’s Inside

- 🧩 RESTful API built using **Node.js** and **Express**
- ✅ Automated testing using **Postman**
- 📦 Mock data for orders and payments
- ⚡ Schema validation and error handling
- 🚫 Negative test cases for invalid endpoints


## 🧪 Example Tests in Postman

Each request includes Postman test scripts to verify:
- Response status codes (200, 201, 204, 404)
- Response time (performance check)
- JSON structure validation
- Field presence (like `Order_id`, `status`, `total_amount`)
- Proper error handling for invalid inputs


## 💻 Tech Stack

- **Node.js** – Backend server setup  
- **Express.js** – API framework  
- **Postman** – API testing and validation  
- **JSON Schema Validator** – Ensures structured and consistent responses
