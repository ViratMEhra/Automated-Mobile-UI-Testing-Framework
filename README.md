# Automated-Mobile-UI-Testing-Framework
This project demonstrates the creation of a mock REST API for an Order Management System and its end-to-end testing using Postman. It showcases how basic API endpoints like creating, updating, fetching, and deleting orders can be structured, validated, and automated through well-defined test scripts.
